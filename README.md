# The Big Feed

![Picture of the website on different devices](assets/images/responsive.png)

I’ve created a web-based application to help users discover recipes based on the ingredients they have to hand. You are able to view this [here](https://sian504.github.io/the-big-feed/).

## Business Goals

The business goals for the site are as follows:

- **Personalised Recipe Recommendations:** The application uses the Tasty API to retrieve recipes based on the ingredients the user inputs, aiming to offer a diverse range of recipes to suit tastes and dietary preferences.
- **Reduce Food Waste:** By suggesting recipes based on the user’s available ingredients, the application helps to make the most of what's leftover in the kitchen, while also promoting sustainability.
- **Enhance Cooking Creativity:** The application aims to encourage culinary exploration and creativity. The recipe suggestions aim to inspire users to try new dishes and cooking techniques, helping them expand their culinary repertoire.

## First-time User Stories

- As a first-time user, I want to be able to easily input the ingredients I have on hand, so the application can suggest recipes that I can make with those ingredients.
- As a first-time user, I want to see a step-by-step guide for the recommended recipes, including ingredients, cooking instructions, and estimated preparation time.
- As a first-time user, I want the application to suggest recipes based on the time I have available to cook, such as quick and easy recipes for busy weeknights or more elaborate dishes for special occasions.

## Returning User Stories

- As a returning user, now I know how the app fully works, I am able to use it on any device so that I can use the app while I am cooking.
- As a returning user, I want to access the site's social media links, so I can follow their updates on different platforms and share this with my friends.

## UX

I designed the site using the core principles of UX. I used this framework to think about my target users and what features would be present on the website.

## Strategy

**The Big Feed** is aimed at the following users:

- **Home Cooks:** The primary audience is likely to be individuals who enjoy cooking at home and are looking for convenient ways to plan meals and discover new recipes.
- **Food Enthusiasts:** People who have a passion for food, cooking, and trying out different cuisines may be interested in using the app to expand their culinary repertoire.
- **Busy Professionals and Families:** Those with busy schedules who need help with meal planning and utilising ingredients on hand efficiently. Families seeking to create diverse and satisfying meals may also find the app useful.
- **Health-Conscious Consumers:** Individuals who are mindful of their dietary preferences and restrictions, including vegetarians, vegans, gluten-free, or other dietary choices.
- **Sustainability Advocates:** People who are environmentally conscious and want to reduce food waste by using up ingredients they already have.

### These users would be looking for the following

- **User-Friendly Recipe Cards:** Each recipe should be presented in an easy-to-read format, including a list of ingredients, and clear step-by-step instructions.
- **Personalised Recommendations:** The website should offer personalised recipe recommendations based on user preferences and ingredients they have on hand. This feature keeps users engaged and encourages exploration.
- **Mobile Responsiveness:** The website should be optimised for mobile devices to ensure a seamless experience for users who access it from smartphones or tablets.

I want to keep the website simple as well as intuitive. I want the interface to be visually appealing as well as user-friendly in the best possible way so that the user is able to understand the purpose of the website straight away.

## Scope

To achieve the business goals and user requirements, I will be including the following features:

- Header and menu that allows users to navigate through all pages of the site
- A visually appealing landing page that explains the purpose of the site
- An easy to use search function that is intuitive and user friendly
- Visually appealing recipe cards that give all the information the user needs to know about the dish 
- Links to social media pages

## Structure

The website will consist of 2 pages:

1. Home page
2. Recipe search and results page

These pages will be contained in a navigation bar that will appear at the top of each page so that the user is able to navigate easily through all sections of the site. The order of the navigation bar appears in order of priority Home > Recipe search. I believe this is a natural progression for the user and a layout that they will expect from this kind of site.

The homepage will consist of a visually appealing image along with a short About section so that users are able to understand the purpose of the site. All text blocks will be minimal to not overwhelm the user but inform them of exactly what they can expect. The recipe search section will allow the user to search for recipes based on the ingredients that they have and will display the results provided by the Tasty API. These will be arranged into recipe cards that will display the name of the dish, an image and a description that will help users to decide whether they want to cook the recipe.
